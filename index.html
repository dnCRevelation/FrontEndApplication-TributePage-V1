                <ul>
                    <label>Development of the Turing Machine (1936)</label>
                    <li>Turing proposed the concept of a Universal Turing Machine, which became a foundational idea in theoretical computer science. It provided a mathematical model for computation, laying the groundwork for modern computers and programming.</li>
                    
                    <label>Breaking the Enigma Code (1939-1945)</label>
                    <li>During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma cipher. He developed the Bombe, an electromechanical device that expedited the decryption process, enabling the Allies to intercept and decode critical military communications. This work is credited with shortening the war by several years and saving millions of lives.</li>
                   
                    <label>Contributions to Cryptography</label>
                    <li>Turing's work in cryptanalysis extended beyond Enigma. He also worked on deciphering the Lorenz cipher (used for high-level German communications) and developed statistical methods that improved the efficiency of codebreaking efforts.</li>
                   
                    <label>Designing the ACE (1945-1948)</label>
                    <li>After the war, Turing designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) at the National Physical Laboratory. Although the full machine was not built during his time, the ACE was among the earliest designs for a stored-program computer, influencing later computer designs globally.</li>
                   
                    <label>The Turing Test (1950)</label>
                    <li>In his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Test, a method for determining if a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence. This test remains a cornerstone of discussions in artificial intelligence and philosophy.</li>
                   
                    <label>Foundations of Artificial Intelligence</label>
                    <li>Turing theorized about machine learning and artificial intelligence, suggesting that machines could one day simulate human cognitive processes. His work in this area is considered visionary and foundational for AI research.</li>
                    
                    <label>Mathematical Contributions (1930s-1940s)</label>
                    <li>Turing made significant advances in pure mathematics, particularly in the field of computability and logic, expanding on ideas from Kurt GÃ¶del and others. His work clarified which problems could be solved by computation.</li>
                    
                    <label>Morphogenesis and Biology (1952)</label>
                    <li>In his later years, Turing turned to biology, publishing a groundbreaking paper on morphogenesis, the process by which patterns and structures form in living organisms. His mathematical models for how chemical substances interact to create biological patterns influenced developmental biology and biomathematics.</li>
